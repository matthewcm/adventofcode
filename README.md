# adventofcode

Advent of code is a yearly event that spans across december. 
It is 25 days of coding challenges, which are normally christmas themed to get you in your jolly mood.

I'll aim to be more consistent with it in 2021. It is just a bit demotivating when some days take up more than one day.

But I should have picked up some problem solving skills by now to get through them quickly.
